## Don't Blame Anyone

 Never complain about anyone, nor anything,
 because basically you have done
 what you wanted in your life.

 Accept the difficulty of improving yourself
 and the courage to start changing yourself.
 The triumph of the true man emerges from
 the ashes of his mistake.

 Never complain about your loneliness or your
 luck, face it with courage and accept it.
 In one way or another it is the outcome of
 your acts and the thought that you always
 have to win.

 Don't be embittered by your own failure or
 blame it on another, accept yourself now or
 you'll keep making excuses for yourself like a child.
 Remember that any time is
 a good time to begin and that nobody
 is so horrible that they should give up.

 Don't forget that the cause of your present
 is your past, as well as the cause of your
 future will be your present.

 Learn from the bold, the strong,
 those who don't accept situations, who
 will live in spite of everything. Think less in
 your problems and more in your work and
 your problems, without eliminating them, will die.

 Learn how to grow from the pain and to be
 greater than the greatest of those
 obstacles. Look at yourself in the mirror
 and you will be free and strong and you will stop
 being a puppet of circumstances because you
 yourself are your own destiny.
 
 Arise and look at the sun in the mornings
 and breathe the light of the dawn.
 You are part of the force of your life;
 now wake up, fight, get going, be decisive
 and you will triumph in life. Never think about
 luck because luck is
 the pretext of losers
